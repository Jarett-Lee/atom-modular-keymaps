# Modular Keymaps
A modular solution to [Atom](https://atom.io) Keymaps.

Any valid keymap (.cson) file inside `ATOM_HOME/keymaps/` will be loaded automatically, or reloaded if modified.

This package doesn't interfere with the existing `keymap.cson`, so you can slowly transition to this more modular approach.

The Atom `Open Your Keymap` menu item to will be overridden to open your keymaps folder in a new window, along with the default `keymap.cson` if it still exists.

## Install
`apm install modular-keymaps` or search under packages within Atom.
